I had the opportunity to present our project, "Brain Similarity Scaling," at the 5th edition of the CERC AAI workshop series, focusing on "AI @ Scale: Capabilities & Alignment." The workshop's central theme explored emergent behaviors and phase transitions in deep learning, crucial for both AI capabilities and alignment and safety.
