        The longer I live, the more I realize that both personal growth and the advancement of humanity are only 
        possible through discussions, collaboration, and mutual support. I wouldn't be who I am today without the 
        help of many people. As a way to give back, I have humbly committed myself to helping the others, with priority 
        given to those currently minoritized in Neuro-AI, as they navigate the challenges of academia to the best of my ability.
