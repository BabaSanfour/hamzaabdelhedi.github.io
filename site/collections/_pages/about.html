        I am a first-year <strong></strong>PhD</strong> student in <strong>Biomedical Engineering</strong> at the <strong>Faculty of Medicine</strong>, Universit√© de Montr√©al, 
        currently conducting research at <strong>MILA (Quebec AI Institute)</strong> and the <strong>Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience Lab</strong> 
        under the supervision of Dr. Karim Jerbi. üéì I just completed my MSc in <strong>Computer Science</strong> with a specialization in <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> 
        at Universit√© de Montr√©al. I also hold a <strong>Telecommunications Engineering diploma</strong> from the Higher School of Communication of Tunis (SUPCOM) 
        and have a background in mathematics from my pre-engineering studies. My research focuses on the intersection of <strong>artificial</strong> ü§ñ and 
        <strong>biological üß† neural networks</strong>, with a particular interest in vision, decision-making, and brain disorders.

      <p style="text-align: justify;">   
        Passionate about sharing knowledge through various formats, I am currently a <strong>teaching assistant</strong> for the courses Methods in Cognitive Neuroscience 
        and Laboratory 1 at the psychology department. üßë‚Äçüè´ I have also had the honor to teach in the <strong>Pathfinders in AI</strong> summer school for Indigenous communities and the 
        <strong>Arabs in Neuroscience Summer School</strong>. I am deeply committed to contributing to society by focusing on <strong>ethics</strong>, <strong>equity</strong>, 
        <strong>diversity</strong>, and <strong>inclusion</strong> in science, while raising awareness about the <strong>socio-environmental risks</strong> and potential dangers of the 
        scientific tools we developüåçüí°. I am co-organizing a bi-weekly reading group with an incredible team on the <strong>misuse of AI in the military</strong> 
        as well as a workshop on the <strong>harms and risks of AI</strong> in this context. In all my activities, I try to focus on supporting the <strong>underprivileged</strong>, 
        <strong>marginalized</strong>, <strong>minoritized</strong>, and <strong>underrepresented</strong> in science and society ‚úäüå±.

          Hamza has received significant support from prestigious research centers, such as the Cerebrum Neuro-AI Scholarship, 
          the UNIQUE Excellence Scholarship (MSc level), and The CIRCA Master Excellence Scholarship to help conduct his research and 
          finish his studies.   
                          
      </p>

      <p style = "text-align: justify;">
          Beyond research and studies, Hamza actively engages in extracurricular initiatives. Currently, he serves as a member of the 
          Student Activities Committee at UNIQUE Research Center, acting as the liaison with the UNIQUE Scientific Committee. 
          As part of his tasks he organized several events such as MAIN, USS. He was also a part of the CuttingEEG Montreal Garden team. 
          Notably, Hamza served as the Chairman at the IEEE SUPCOM Student 
          Branch during his engineering studies. He successfully organized the inaugural edition of the Deep Learning IndabaX in Tunisia, 
          which stands as the largest AI event in Africa, held in 2018. In 2020, Hamza earned the third prize in the SUPCOM 
          entrepreneurship challenge and was honored with the title of the best IEEE Region 8 (EMEA) Entrepreneurship Initiative Ambassador.
          Additionally, he was awarded travel grants to participate in the 2020 edition of the Smart Green Island makeathon in Spain. -->

        Failures/Rejections are often seen as a negative aspect of life and never shared nor discussed. However, I see them as an 
        essential part of the learning process and another metric to success as the challenges I had to overcome to reach my goals.
        Here are some instances of rejection I've faced.
