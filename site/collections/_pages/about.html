  I am a first-year <strong>PhD</strong> student in <strong>Biomedical Engineering</strong> at the
  <strong>Faculty of Medicine</strong>, Université de Montréal,
  currently conducting research at <strong>MILA (Quebec AI Institute)</strong> and the <strong>Cognitive and
    Computational Neuroscience Lab</strong>
  under the supervision of Dr. Karim Jerbi. 🎓 I just completed my MSc in <strong>Computer Science</strong> with a
  specialization in <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>
  at Université de Montréal. I also hold a <strong>Telecommunications Engineering diploma</strong> from the Higher
  School of Communication of Tunis (SUPCOM)
  and have a background in mathematics from my pre-engineering studies. My research focuses on the intersection of
  <strong>artificial</strong> 🤖 and
  <strong>biological 🧠 neural networks</strong>, with a particular interest in vision, decision-making, and brain
  disorders.

  Passionate about sharing knowledge through various formats, I am currently a <strong>teaching assistant</strong> for
  the courses Methods in Cognitive Neuroscience
  and Laboratory 1 at the psychology department. 🧑‍🏫 I have also had the honor to teach in the <strong>Pathfinders in
    AI</strong> summer school for Indigenous communities and the
  <strong>Arabs in Neuroscience Summer School</strong>. I am deeply committed to contributing to society by focusing on
  <strong>ethics</strong>, <strong>equity</strong>,
  <strong>diversity</strong>, and <strong>inclusion</strong> in science, while raising awareness about the
  <strong>socio-environmental risks</strong> and potential dangers of the
  scientific tools we develop🌍💡. I am co-organizing a bi-weekly reading group with an incredible team on the
  <strong>misuse of AI in the military</strong>
  as well as a workshop on the <strong>harms and risks of AI</strong> in this context. In all my activities, I try to
  focus on supporting the <strong>underprivileged</strong>,
  <strong>marginalized</strong>, <strong>minoritized</strong>, and <strong>underrepresented</strong> in science and
  society ✊🌱.

Tiohtià:ke/Montréal is on unceded Indigenous lands. I recognize the Kanien'kehá:ka Nation as the custodians of the lands
and waters on which I live and work.
For the few years I lived in Montréal, I have come to embrace it as my home and am learning about the rich history of
the land and the peoples who have lived here for
thousands of years. I extend my deep gratitude to them, celebrate the beauty and diversity of this land, and reaffirm my
commitment to truth and
reconciliation—of which this statement is but one small step.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Failures/Rejections are often seen as a negative aspect of life and never shared nor discussed. However, I see them as
  an
  essential part of the learning process and another metric to success as the challenges I had to overcome to reach my
  goals.
  Here are some instances of rejection I've faced.
